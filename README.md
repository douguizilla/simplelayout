## Simple Layout

This project was created to exercise the knowledge coming from the book Dominando Android com Kotlin in chapter 2. To create this layout I used:

 - Linear layout,
 - Relative layout,
 - Recyclerview
 - Toolbar
 - Vector Assets
 - Cardview
 - Samples from tools
 - Font: [VeganStyle](https://www.dafont.com/vegan-style.font)

Open to new ideas!
